# FCV-EMS-raw
This is the implementation of a raw dynamic programming (DP) for the energy management of a simple fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). 
- DP_raw_live.mlx: The main DP program in live script matlab format to show intermediate results in a interactive way. 
- DP_raw.m: main DP program in .m format which is equivalent to the live script. 
- func_L_raw.m: FCEV model function. 
- func_phi_raw.m: cost related to the final SOC.
- Power_FCV_demande.mat: load power versus time of an arbitrary driving cycle. 
- func_pmp_raw.m: function used for PMP EMS
- PMP_raw.m: main program for PMP implementation
- func_ecms_raw.m: function used for ECMS EMS
- ECMS_raw.m main program for ECMS implementation
